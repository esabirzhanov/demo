Here is assignment specification: 

Task: 

Please define and implement a rest API to match the following problem.... 

Problem Definition: 

We need an API to manage devices in our system.
The API needs to be able to create, update and find these devices by serial number and machine code. The minimum fields required for the device or as follows: 

		-  Serial number

		-  Machine code

		-  Device name

We need the API to make sure the managed devices have serial numbers that match a certain format for entry.

   12 - 1222

   3455670 - 22222

   1 - 00022221 

These are all valid entries for serial numbers. 

If a serial number is not in that format then an error message with error code ER003, message and resourceKey should be sent in the API
Ensure that the machine codes are not blank. If the machine code is blank , An error message ER001 should be presented along with the resourcekey and the message
If the serial number or the machine code is not found in the persistent store (e.g. SQL Server) an error code with ER002 and/or ER004 should be presented along with the resourcekey and the message

Json error messages: 

[ { 

"resourceKey": "machine.code.not.found",

"errorCode": "ER002",

"message": "The machine code does not match our records." 

}, { 

"resourceKey": "machine.code.invalid",

"errorCode": "ER001",

"message": "The machine code is incorrect. Check the Machine code you provided and try again." 

}, {

"resourceKey": "serial.number.invalid",

"errorCode": "ER003",

"message": "The serial number entered can include a - z, A - Z, 0 - 9 and hyphen. Please correct your 
entry." 

}, {

"resourceKey": "serial.number.not.found",

"errorCode": "ER004",

"message": "The serial number does not match our records." 

} ]
